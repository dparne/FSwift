# [FSwift](https://github.com/kperson/FSwift/) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/kperson/FSwift.png?branch=mapreduce)](https://travis-ci.org/kperson/FSwift)

FSwift is a framework for functional programming in Swift.  The goal is provide missing functional pieces for Apple's Swift language.  If you are not familiar with functional programming, I would recommend watching [Functional Principles for Object-Oriented Development - Jessica Kerr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpXsQ-NIKXY).  It is a great introduction for those coming from an object-oriented background.

## Features

* *Future and Promises* -- manage current operations using a simple Future and Promises implementation
* *Array Extensions* -- peform run functional operations like reduce, map reduce, and fold
* *Time Extensions* -- convert integers to NSTimeintevals (e.g. let time = 5.minutes)

## Installation
